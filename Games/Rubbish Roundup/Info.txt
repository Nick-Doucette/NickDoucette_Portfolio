**Description

-This folder contains an very early Android build of Rubbish Roundup created in the Unity engine

-Rubbish Roundup is a physics based puzzle game where the player must navigate a small boat through various levels to clean up garbage from polluted waters

-I worked on it as part of a team of 3 (2 designers/programmers, and 1 artist)

-We worked on this game in our free time from Febuary 2021 until around August 2021

-Although we intended to release it and could still finish it in the future, we havent had the free time to continue development

-This is a very early build that contains a lot of the core mechanics we had in mind, and a few test levels for those mechanics

-It also contains some art assets created by our artist, as well as a lot of placeholder art


**Instructions for installation

-To play this game, simply transfer the file "RR_TestBuild_301021.apk" to any android device, and run it
